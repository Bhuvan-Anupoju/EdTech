#### ðŸ”°overview
- I developed a fully responsive homepage for an EdTech website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to deliver a seamless learning experience across devices. The homepage features a visually appealing hero section, clear navigation, and well-structured content sections highlighting courses, features, and testimonials. Smooth animations and interactive elements enhance user engagement, while the mobile-first design ensures accessibility on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. This project focuses on clean UI, user-friendly layout, and performance optimization for better usability.
